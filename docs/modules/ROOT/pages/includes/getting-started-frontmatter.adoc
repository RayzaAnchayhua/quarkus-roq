== Getting started

By default, your site should be located in the `site` directory of your project root, or in the resources (i.e. `src/main/resources/site`).

The site directory structure is:

// https://excalidraw.com/#json=r097DRsiEfB1ivnrhz5ky,X5N6SEHHofuhh7vII-81OQ


NOTE: The https://pages.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-roq/[Roq blog] is a good example of site made with Roq (https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/tree/main/blog[sources]).


=== Site index

Your site index is required and should be located in `site/index.html`, it should include a FrontMatter header containing yaml data:
[source,html]
.index.html
----
---
title: Hello, world! I'm Roq <1>
description: I provide you with all the tools to generate static websites out of your Quarkus web application.
layout: main //<2>
---

<h1>Hello World</h1>

----

<1> The index.html also describe your `site` information through a FrontMatter header
<2> The layout to use (in this case `main` which refers to `site/_layout/main.html`)

=== Variables

You can use Qute to access site and pages data. For this use the `site` and `page` variables:

* The `site` variable allow to access site global data from any page or document.
* The `page` variable allow to access page data for the current page. It is available in layouts and includes and will contain the data for the page it is used from.

=== Pages

Any directory without the `_` prefix in the site directory will be scanned for pages content.

For example:
[source,html]
.pages/events.html
----
---
layout: main
link: /events
---

{#for event in cdi:events.list}
<article class="event">
  <div class="event-content">
    <h2 class="event-title">{event.title}</h2>
    <p>{event.description}</p>
    <span class="post-date">{event.parsedDate.format('yyyy, MMM dd')}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
</article>
{/for}

----

=== Collections

TODO

=== Static files, Styles and Javascript

NOTE: The Quarkus Web Bundler is included by default with the Roq extension.

Put your static files in `src/main/resources/web/static`.

You can add css and scripts in your static directory or bundle them.
To use bundling scripts (js, ts) and styles (css, scss) should be located in `src/main/web/app/`. To include the generated bundle in your template, specify the bundle tag in the `html>head` tag:

[source,html]
._layouts/head.html
----
<head>
  ...
  {#bundle /}
</head>
----

It will be rendered with the relevant `<script>` and `<style>` tags to include your bundle.

You may also consume and bundle npm dependencies among other cool things.
