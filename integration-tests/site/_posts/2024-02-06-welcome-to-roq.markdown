You’ll find this post in your `site/_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `quarkus dev`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `site/_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Qute also offers powerful support for code snippets:
